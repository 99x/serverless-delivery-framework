### Developing Locally

```
script/server
```

Running `script/server` will run `jekyll serve && compass --watch` commands via terminal. You will be able to open http://localhost:4000 and make changes to any of the, md, .html or .scss files and compass will compile them for you. Simply refresh your browser (or use something like livereload) and develop away. Most of the colors and sizing is found in the _variables.scss file.
